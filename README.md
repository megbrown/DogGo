# DogGo

## BACKGROUND

This project was inspired by an organization I volunteer with, Tails of the Trail. They are developing an initiative called Freedom Ride, a dog relocation service that transports homeless dogs from kill shelters in overpopulated middle TN to no-kill shelters in less populated geographic areas.

## OBJECTIVE

Build an application for the Freedom Ride initiative that would make the relocation process easier for the Tails of the Trail organization, source shelters, and destination shelters.

## KEY TERMS
**Source shelters**: shelters in Middle TN that have too many dogs and are participating in the program to move dogs from their location to other shelters

**Destination shelters**: shelters in other regions of the US that have space to accept dogs from source shelters

**Tails of the Trail (TOTT)**: Non-profit organization that organizes the transfer of dogs from source shelters to destination shelters

**Freedom Rides**: A monthly/bi-monthly ride from source shelters to destination shelters. One ride could involve multiple source shelters, destination shelters, and up to 15 dogs.

Dog status:<br>
	**Available**: Dogs uploaded in app - have not been selected by a destination shelter<br>
	**Selected**: Available dogs that have been selected by a destination shelter<br>
	**On Ride**: Selected dogs that have been chosen for a ride by TOTT<br>
